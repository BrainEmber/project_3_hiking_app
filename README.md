## Introduction

Our project is a full MEAN stack applicaton that uses not only its own API but also utilizes data from the open weather api. The purpose of our app is to provide hikers with data on what to expect and bring on a hike. The user types in a location and they are told vital factors regarding wind conditions and temperature. In addition based on these factors we recommend the amount of water to consume and also provide important information on clothing.
